Passionate about finding solutions to real world problems with code and software.
Currently looking for my next opportunity to be part of a software team to
contribute to their success. I bring a positive upbeat attitude with a unique 
perspective on things along with a mind for logic and efficiency.

I have done a range of development work including writing macros, migrating
data, server setup, building websites (full stack), interfacing with web API's 
to push/pull data, managed complex databases, interfaced with clients to

and advanced data structures through college courses, and very familiar with
C++ STL and Java's core API implementations as well as how both languages 
execute.

A few years ago I became more and more interested in personal use drones but
realized I would need a stronger grasp in mathematics, physics, and would need
to familiarize myself with embedded programming. As such I decided it would be
most efficient to return to college as it provides structure for establishing
the foundational knowledge I required. I have about
